# Sleep-Disorder-Analysis-Excel

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to explore relationships between sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or None) and various lifestyle, demographic, and health factors.
The goal is to identify patterns and insights that highlight how different factors—such as age, gender, stress level, blood pressure, and job type—affect sleep quality and disorders.

The analysis was conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel, using its built-in features to clean, explore, and visualize the data.


# Tools Used

Microsoft Excel:

- Data Cleaning (removing inconsistencies, formatting)

- Created a new categorical column for Stress Level:
    - Converted numeric values into Low, Moderate, and High categories

- Pivot Tables for summarization

- Charts (bar, line, pie, and column charts) for visualization


# Key Insights

- Gender & Weight: Sleep disorder prevalence increases with higher BMI, and the patterns differ between males and females.

- Job Type: Professions such as nurses, salespersons, and teachers showed a higher prevalence of sleep disorders compared to other job categories.

- Age Factor: Middle-aged and older groups showed higher sleep disorder prevalence.

- Blood Pressure: Elevated blood pressure correlated with higher sleep disorder counts.
